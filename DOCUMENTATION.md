# 1. Welcome to Git and GitHub at ChaiCode Cohort!
The purpose of the documentation in software industry especially for new onboarding employees is that :

**GIT & GITHUB** are essential tools for developers on today's world in advancing technology.

# 2. Basics of Git & Github :

### GIT :
-  It is a version control system software(VCS) that keeps the track of all the changes made in the source code. It's essential for developers as it helps in maintaining the history of code and help in collabortion.
- It is the most widely used VCS in software industry.

- Need of Git ? :- Git, being a VCS helps in several ways, here are some points listed below :

1. **TRACKING CHANGES** : It keeps the record of the what changes made by developers in source file and when.
2. **COLLABORATION** : Multiple people can work on the same project without hindering the changes made by other.
3. **BACKUP** : It acts as a backup source for the file whether its code or anything else.

# 3. Installation and Setup:



# 4. Check you GIT version: 
- To check the current version of git in your system, you can run the following command in your terminal :

# 5. Basic Terminologies :
1. **Repository** : It is like a folder or storage where all your project files along with the changes made in it are stored.
2. **Commit** : It's a way to save changes in your code. It's necessary step. After commit we can add a commit message as well so that we would get to know at what time and where the change were being made.
- We can think of it like this : Write --> add --> commit --> push
3. **Directory** : It's a location where all the files are being stored. (basically the folder in which we are working at that time)
4. **Staging Area** : It's a place when the code is ready to be pushed and ready to have commit messages by the developer.

# 6. Git Workflow :
- git init --> working directory --> git add --> staging area --> git commit --> Repo --> git push --> Github

# 4. Basic Git Commands:
 - git init : Initialize a new Git repository
 - git add . : Stage all changes in the current directory
 - git commit -m "message" : Commit staged changes with a message
 - git push : Push commits to a remote repository
 - git pull : Fetch and merge changes from a remote repo
 - git branch : List branches
 - git clone <url> : Clone a repository from a URL
